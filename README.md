### Hepatitis in the United States

The data we will be using come from the Project Tycho data level 2 which is contain 50 diseases 50 US states and 1284 cities. 
As part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) , 
viral hepatitis case-reports are received electronically from U.S. state and territorial health departments via CDC's 
National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS), a computerized public health surveillance system that provides CDC with data on a weekly basis.
Although the surveillance infrastructure was in place for states to report both acute and chronic infections, case-reports of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and
past or present hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, which account for the greatest burden of disease, were not submitted by all states; in 2014, 40 states submitted
reports of chronic HBV infection.
